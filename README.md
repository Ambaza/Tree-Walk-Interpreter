# Tree-Walk-Interpreter
Tree Walk Interpreter to simulate the execution of a program based on its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
This interpreter supports basic arithmetic operations and can handle nested expressions. It's a simple example to give you an idea of how an interpreter walks through the AST to simulate program execution.

For more complex languages, you would need to extend the interpreter to handle variables, scopes, control flow statements, and other language constructs.
